 * Enum representing the roles that a user can have in the system.

 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #ROLE_ADMIN} - Has full access to all system features and administrative actions.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ROLE_SELLER} - Can manage products, view orders, and handle their store operations.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ROLE_CUSTOMER} - Can browse products, place orders, and manage their account.</li>

 * <pre>
 * if (user.getRole() == UserRole.ROLE_ADMIN) {
